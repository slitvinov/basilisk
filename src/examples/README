== 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami ==

Edit tsunami.c, change "/home/popinet/terrain" if required.

Run the simulation with:

% make tsunami.tst

The standard error is in tsunami.log i.e. do:

% tail -f tsunami.log

if you want to see what is happening.

Display the results (also works while it's running) with:

% plaympeg -l eta.mpg
% plaympeg -l level.mpg
% plaympeg -l pid.mpg

(you will need ffmpeg on your system for this to work,
 use totem, vlc, another movie player etc... if you don't have plaympeg).

Generate and display graphs (after completion, requires gnuplot > 4.2):

% make tsunami.png
% eog *.png
