Here is what you need to do to run the examples. We will take the [2004 Indian
 ocean tsunami](tsunami.c) as an example. Start by following the link and read 
the documented source code. Then edit [tsunami.c]() with your favourite text
editor and change `/home/popinet/terrain` as required in the [initial 
conditions](tsunami.c#initial-conditions).

You can then run the simulation with:

~~~bash
make tsunami.tst
~~~

The standard error is in `tsunami.log` i.e. do:

~~~bash
tail -f tsunami.log
~~~

if you want to see what is happening.

Display the results (also works while it's running) with:

~~~bash
plaympeg -l eta.mpg
plaympeg -l level.mpg
plaympeg -l pid.mpg
~~~

(you will need ffmpeg on your system for this to work. Use totem, vlc,
another movie player etc... if you don't have plaympeg).

Generate and display graphs (after completion, requires gnuplot > 4.2):

~~~bash
make tsunami.png
eog *.png
~~~
