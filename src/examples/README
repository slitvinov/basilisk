== How to run examples ==

We will take the [2004 Indian ocean tsunami](tsunami.c) as an
example. Start by following the link and read the documented source
code. Then edit [tsunami.c]() with your favourite text editor and
change "/home/popinet/terrain" as required.

Run the simulation with:

~~~sh
make tsunami.tst
~~~

The standard error is in `tsunami.log` i.e. do:

~~~sh
tail -f tsunami.log
~~~

if you want to see what is happening.

Display the results (also works while it's running) with:

~~~sh
plaympeg -l eta.mpg
plaympeg -l level.mpg
plaympeg -l pid.mpg
~~~

(you will need ffmpeg on your system for this to work, use totem, vlc,
another movie player etc... if you don't have plaympeg).

Generate and display graphs (after completion, requires gnuplot > 4.2):

~~~sh
make tsunami.png
eog *.png
~~~
