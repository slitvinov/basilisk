Two options are possible:

1. Using [off-screen rendering](https://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html):
OSMesa is a software-only implementation of OpenGL i.e. it does not
require any graphics hardware and is thus suitable for installation on
large-scale clusters which usually do not have graphical
capabilities. Both libGLU and libOSMesa are required.

On a Debian-based system use:

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev libosmesa6-dev
~~~

to install the required system libraries, then do:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
make libglutils.a libfb_osmesa.a
~~~

to compile the libraries provided by Basilisk.

2. Using graphics-acceleration hardware: if a graphics card is
installed on the system, this can be used to provide faster OpenGL
graphics. libGLU, libGLEW, libGL and libX11 are required.

On a Debian-based system use:

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
~~~

to install the required system libraries, then do:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
make libglutils.a libfb_glx.a
~~~

to compile the libraries provided by Basilisk.
