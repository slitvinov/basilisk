Two options are possible: off-screen rendering or using
graphics-acceleration hardware.

# Using off-screen rendering

[OSMesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html) is a software-only
implementation of OpenGL i.e. it does not require any graphics
hardware and is thus suitable for installation on large-scale clusters
which usually do not have graphical capabilities. Both libGLU and
libOSMesa are required.

## Debian-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev libosmesa6-dev
~~~

to install the required system libraries (and their "development"
requirements i.e. header files etc.), then do:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
make libglutils.a libfb_osmesa.a
~~~

to compile the libraries provided by Basilisk.

## Mac OSX

You first need to install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org), then
do:

~~~bash
sudo port install mesa
~~~

to install the required system libraries, then do:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include make libglutils.a libfb_osmesa.a
~~~

to compile the libraries provided by Basilisk.

# Using graphics-acceleration hardware

If a graphics card is installed on the system, this can be used to
provide faster OpenGL graphics. libGLU, libGLEW, libGL and libX11 are
required.

## Debian-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

Use

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
~~~

to install the required system libraries (and their "development"
requirements i.e. header files etc.), then do:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
make libglutils.a libfb_glx.a
~~~

to compile the libraries provided by Basilisk.

# Standalone installation

The libraries are independent from Basilisk and can be installed
separately. This is useful for example when [running on
supercomputers](/src/Tips#running-on-supercomputers) which do not have
Basilisk installed.

This can be done easily using something like:

On the local system:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK
tar czvf gl.tgz gl
scp gl.tgz login@supercomputer.org:
~~~

On the remote machine:

~~~bash
tar xzvf gl.tgz
cd gl
make clean
~~~

and then follow the [installation
instructions](#using-off-screen-rendering) above.
