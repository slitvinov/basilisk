Two options are possible: off-screen rendering or using
graphics-acceleration hardware.

# Using [off-screen rendering](https://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html)

OSMesa is a software-only implementation of OpenGL i.e. it does not
require any graphics hardware and is thus suitable for installation on
large-scale clusters which usually do not have graphical
capabilities. Both libGLU and libOSMesa are required.

## Debian-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev libosmesa6-dev
~~~

to install the required system libraries (and their "development"
requirements i.e. header files etc.), then do:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
make libglutils.a libfb_osmesa.a
~~~

to compile the libraries provided by Basilisk.

## Mac OSX

You first need to install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org), then
do:

~~~bash
sudo port install mesa
~~~

to install the required system libraries, then do:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include make libglutils.a libfb_osmesa.a
~~~

to compile the libraries provided by Basilisk.

# Using graphics-acceleration hardware

If a graphics card is installed on the system, this can be used to
provide faster OpenGL graphics. libGLU, libGLEW, libGL and libX11 are
required.

## Debian-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

Use

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
~~~

to install the required system libraries (and their "development"
requirements i.e. header files etc.), then do:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
make libglutils.a libfb_glx.a
~~~

to compile the libraries provided by Basilisk.
