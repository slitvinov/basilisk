# Incompressible Navier--Stokes solver (centered formulation)

We wish to approximate numerically the incompressible,
variable-density Navier--Stokes equations
$$

\frac{1}{\rho}\left[-\nabla p + \nabla\cdot(\mu\nabla\mathbf{u})\right] +

The scheme implemented here is close to that used in Gerris ([Popinet,
2003](/src/references.bib#popinet2003), [Popinet,
2009](/src/references.bib#popinet2009), [LagrÃ©e et al,
2011](/src/references.bib#lagree2011)).

We will use the generic time loop, a CFL-limited timestep, the
Bell-Collela-Glaz advection scheme and the implicit viscosity
solver. */
