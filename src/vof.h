# Volume-Of-Fluid advection

We want to approximate the solution of the advection equations
$$
\partial_tc_i + \mathbf{u}_f\cdot\nabla c_i = 0
$$
where $c_i$ are volume fraction fields describing sharp interfaces.

This can be done using a conservative, non-diffusive geometric VOF
scheme.

We also add the option to transport diffusive tracers confined to one
side of the interface i.e. solve the equations
$$
\partial_tt_{i,j} + \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{u}_ft_{i,j}) = 0
$$
with $t_{i,j} = c_if_j$ (or $t_{i,j} = (1 - c_i)f_j$) and $f_j$ is a
volumetric tracer concentration.

The list of tracers associated with the volume fraction is stored in
the *tracers* attribute. For each tracer, the "side" of the interface
(i.e. either $c$ or $1 - c$) is controlled by the *inverse*
attribute). */
