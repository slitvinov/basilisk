# Running and creating test cases (and examples)

First make sure to read the [section on
Makefiles](/Tutorial#using-makefiles) in the [tutorial](/Tutorial).

To run a particular test case yourself, you can then just do

~~~bash
cd src/test
make bump2D1.tst
~~~

which should give something like

    ...
    qcc -g -O2 -Wall -o bump2D1/bump2D1 bump2D1.c -lm
    [bump2D1.tst]

This indicates that the test compiled and ran successfully. 

## Error checking

If the test fails, you will get something like

    ...
    > 2.5 434 0.0678117 0.164104 0.11299303
    > # refined 80 cells, coarsened 108 cells
    make: *** [bump2D1.tst] Error 1

The last line indicates that make failed. The lines before this are
the output of

~~~bash
diff bump2D1/log bump2D1.ref
~~~

That is, to check whether the test case succeeded or not, the default
Makefile of Basilisk just compares (using
[*diff*](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html)) the *log*
file created by the program to the matching reference log file (with
the *.ref* extension).

To create your own test case (let's call it *mytest*), you only need
to create the source code (i.e. *mytest.c*), run it to create the
*mytest/log* file, check that you are happy with the results and copy
*mytest/log* into *mytest.ref*.

## Graphics

Most tests (but not all) also produce some kind of graph summarising
the results (which allows for example to understand more easily
how/why a particular test failed). Some tests produce these graphs
directly when they run, but most rely on *gnuplot* to generate the
graphs in a post-processing step.

This step is not automatically executed when doing *make
test.tst*. This allows for example to run the test suite on *bare
bones* systems which do not have gnuplot installed.

The makefile system knows about two kinds of graphics: *"inline" plots*
and *"offline" plots*.

### Inline plots

These are generated using gnuplot commands embedded directly in
the documentation comments of the source code (*mytest.c*). Using 
the standard wiki syntax for scripts these commands appear as

    ~~~gnuplot Caption
    set output 'plotname.png'
    ...
    ~~~

and are replaced by the corresponding figure when the page is displayed
in the wiki. Note that the *set output* command is optional. If you 
don't supply a file name, a unique name looking like *_plot1.png* will be
generated automatically.

To generate the figures from the command line, just do

~~~bash
make mytest/plots
~~~

### Offline plots

Alternatively, one can put the gnuplot commands in a separate 
*mytest.plot* file. Note that this method offers few advantages
compared to "inline plots" (the prefered option).

To generate the corresponding plots, one can then do

~~~bash
make bump2D1/plot.png
~~~

which should give something like

    cd bump2D1 && gnuplot -e "batch=1; PNG=\"pngcairo\" ... ../bump2D1.plot ...

Note that, while *plot.png* is the default name for the generated
graph, the gnuplot script can also generate other graphs. Doing

~~~bash
ls bump2D1/*.png
~~~

(or *`eog bump2D1/*.png`*) reveal them all.

Note that if you try to generate plots for a test case which does not
have a corresponding *.plot* gnuplot script, you will get something
like

~~~bash
make events/plot.png
make: *** No rule to make target `events/plot.png'.  Stop.
~~~

## Running the entire test suite

Use something like

~~~bash
cd src/test/
make -k -j8
~~~

where *-k* tells *make* not to stop at the first error and *-j8* uses
parallel processing (assuming you have at least 8 cores on your
system).

If you want to generate all the graphs at once, do

~~~bash
make plots
~~~
