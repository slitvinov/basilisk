# How to contribute new code or bug fixes

## Using darcs

This is the preferred option since [darcs](http://darcs.net/) is the
[version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
used to manage the source code and wiki of Basilisk.

If you followed the [installation instructions](INSTALL#using-darcs)
(using darcs), you can easily generate a new patch for the Basilisk
main distribution using the following workflow:

1. `cd $BASILISK`
2. Synchronize your repo with the main branch using `darcs pull`.
3. Edit the source files.
4. Test that the changes work:
   [add a test case](test/README#running-and-creating-test-cases-and-examples),
   [run the test suite](test/README#running-and-creating-test-cases-and-examples).
5. If you created new files, add them to the distribution using `darcs add`.
6. Check that your code follows the
   [coding style guidelines](#coding-style-guidelines).
7. Review and record the changes using `darcs record`.
8. If you are still not happy with your patch, you can go back
   to 1. and use `darcs amend` to modify it until your are satistfied.

Note that, for consistency, the patch title should start with a capital
and also be reasonably descriptive. Avoid titles such as "Modified
this file", we (through darcs) already know which files are modified
by the patch, rather you should explain concisely what the patch does. Use

~~~bash
darcs changes | more
~~~

to see examples of patch titles and summary.

Also for consistency, your identity/authorship should be something
like:

~~~
Joe Bloggs <joe.bloggs@foo.net>
~~~

You can change it by editing the `$HOME/.darcs/author` file.

You are then ready to submit your patch. You have two options: a
simple one (email) and a more systematic one (publishing your repo).

### Emailing your patch(es)

Just use `darcs send -o patches` (with a better name than `patches`)
and select which patches you want to submit. Attach the `patches` file
to an email and send it (with some explanations) to the
[basilisk-fr mailing list](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/basilisk-fr).

### Publishing your repository

You can use a darcs hosting service, such as
[darcs hub](https://hub.darcs.net/) to publish your repository. Note
that both the Basilisk wiki and source code are
[mirrored on darcs hub](https://hub.darcs.net/basilisk). To create
your own branch, login into darcs hub, go to the
[basilisk repo](https://hub.darcs.net/basilisk/basilisk) and use the
`fork` button.

Note that if you have ssh/scp access to a web server somewhere, you
can also simply copy your repository there.

To publish your changes, you can then `darcs push` them to this
repository and send its http:// address together with your message to
the mailing list.

## Using Unix patches

If for some reason you don't want/can't use darcs, you can simply send
a [Unix patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)) to the
mailing list. Let's assume you modified `src/fractions.h`. You first
need to get back to the original version of this file (using the
original tarball, getting the raw page source on the wiki etc.) and
save it as `src/fractions.h.orig`, then do:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK
diff -u fractions.h.orig fractions.h > fractions.patch
~~~

You can then review the changes in the patch file and send it to the
mailing list if you are happy with it. Note that much more complex
patches (for multiple files and directories etc.) can be
generated. See the many online tutorials if you want to know more
about patching.

# Coding style guidelines

Before submitting new patches, please check that your code verifies
the following conventions:

1. It is indented properly. You should (must!) use a text editor which
   does this automatically. The standard indentation is two
   spaces. This is the default in emacs for example. In emacs you can
   easily indent/reindent an entire block of code by selecting it
   (with Ctrl-space or the mouse) and hitting the TAB key.

2. Lines are not longer than 80 characters. If necessary reformat the
   code by cutting lines in logical places to make them fit. This is
   also true of comment/documentation blocks. Note that emacs will
   automatically reformat long paragraphs of text if you use ESC-q.

3. Comments starting with "/**" are assumed to be formatted using the
   [wiki markdown](/Help#markdown) syntax. Please respect/use
   this. They are meant to be written using
   grammatically/typographically correct sentences i.e. starting with
   capitals, ending with ., with a subject and a verb, proper spelling
   etc. This is what
   [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
   is about.
   
4. Check that your code 'fits in' stylistically with the existing code
   i.e. look around and copy what you see!. In particular, the
   Basilisk convention is to use "natural" punctuation/spaces. For
   example, commas are always followed by a space and opening and
   closing parenthesis are preceded (resp. followed) by a space. For
   readability, the '+' and '-' operators are preceded and followed by
   a space, but the '*' and '/' operators are not.

This may seem like nitpicking but think how disagreable it is to read
a text which is full of spelling mistakes and/or typographic
errors. The same holds for code and, with some discipline (which is
also generally useful when programming...) and some training,
following the conventions above is not difficult.
