You should only need a C99-compliant compiler.

If you are using gcc on a UNIX-like system, this should work:

% ln -s config.gcc config
% make

If you are using another system/compiler, find a config file which
looks close to yours. Try:

% ls config.*
% cp config.[your pick] config
% make

before creating your own (also consider sharing your config file).
