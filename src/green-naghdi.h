# A solver for the Green-Naghdi equations

The Green-Naghdi equations (also known as the Serre or fully nonlinear
Boussinesq equations) can be seen as an extension of the [Saint-Venant
equations](saint-venant.h) to the next order in term of the
*shallowness parameter*
$$
\mu = \frac{h_0^2}{L^2}
$$
with $h_0$ the typical depth and $L$ the typical horizontal scale. In
contrast to the Saint-Venant equations the Green-Naghdi equations have
*dispersive* wave solutions.

This solver is built following the ideas of [Le MÃ©tayer et al,
2010](/src/references.bib#lemetayer2010).

Using the non-local change of variable
$$
K = \left( 1 +\mathcal{T} \right) u
$$
with the operator $\mathcal{T}$ defined as
$$
\mathcal{T}w = - \frac{1}{3 h} \nabla \left( h^3 \nabla\cdot w \right)
$$
the Green-Naghdi system of equations can be written (in one dimension)
$$
\partial_th + \partial_x(hu) = 0
$$
$$
\partial_thK + \partial_x\left(hKu +\frac{gh^2}{2}+\alpha\right) = 0
$$
with
$$
\alpha = -\frac{2}{3}h^3(\partial_xu)^2
$$
This system can be solved using the solver for systems of conservation
laws, and the operator $\mathcal{T}$ can be inverted with the Poisson
solver (to recover $u$ from $K$). */
